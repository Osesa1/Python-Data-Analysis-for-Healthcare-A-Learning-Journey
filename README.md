# Python-Data-Analysis-for-Healthcare-A-Learning-Journey
Overview

Hello, and thank you for visiting my project on Python Data Analysis for Healthcare. As I learn to utilize Python programming and data analysis approaches to tackle real-world healthcare challenges, this repository tracks my experience as I become more proficient in these areas. My primary objectives are establishing a solid data analysis foundation and gaining practical experience working with healthcare datasets.

## Objectives

- **Learn Python Programming**: Master the basics of Python, including data types, control structures, functions, and libraries.
- **Explore Healthcare Data**: Understand how to work with healthcare datasets, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Apply Data Analysis Techniques**: Use statistical methods, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to extract insights from healthcare data.
- **Document the Learning Process**: Keep detailed notes and explanations of the concepts and techniques I learn along the way.

## Repository Structure

- **/notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks where I practice and document my Python data analysis learning process.
- **/data/**: Healthcare datasets used in the analysis (note: ensure any sensitive data is handled according to privacy guidelines).
- **/scripts/**: Python scripts that demonstrate key concepts and techniques in data analysis.
- **/resources/**: Useful articles, tutorials, and references that have helped me in my learning journey.
- **/projects/**: Mini-projects applying what Iâ€™ve learned to specific healthcare-related problems.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/osesa1/python-healthcare-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
    Make sure Python is installed on your system, then install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks**:
    Start with the notebooks in the `/notebooks/` directory. These contain step-by-step explanations of Python basics, data analysis techniques, and applications to healthcare data.

## Key Learning Topics

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using libraries like Pandas and NumPy to manipulate and analyze data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and probability distributions.
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning using Scikit-learn.
- **Healthcare Applications**: Applying data analysis techniques to real-world healthcare datasets, such as predicting disease outcomes, analyzing patient data, and more.

## Healthcare Datasets Used

- **Diabetes Dataset**: Analyzing factors that contribute to diabetes.
- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign.
- **Heart Disease Dataset**: Exploring risk factors for heart disease.
- **Stroke Prediction Dataset**: Identifying key predictors of stroke.

## Learning Progress

- **In Progress**: Python basics, data manipulation, basic data visualization.
- **Next Steps**: Applying machine learning models to healthcare datasets and building a final project.
